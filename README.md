### Technologies used and researched
1. This site uses both Flexbox and Grid CSS styles.  The header uses grid and the card container uses flexbox. Grid styling was researched for this and my first attempt at using Grid for a layout. 
2. The CSS has been normalized using npm, which installed within a node-module folder a separate folder called Normalize.css.  Within this folder lies a file, normalize.css.  This path is: node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css.  3. Using Icons was researched as well as positioning and styling these.  Some improvements that could be made in this area are coloring svg's and expanding elements. 
3. Logo maker.  I actually used a premade logo and cropped it's background using remove.bg.
4. HTML head tags and metadata.  Links for node to normalize, media query (Resposive layout), and for icon use.


#### Future Updates: 
1. Could use a flexbox container instead for VIEWS area within each card container.
2. Could also use icons from font-awesome for sizing and container qualities (Appears to come with free account).
3. Could use icons from Nucleo for their coloring options.  (Also possible with fontawesome but with a $70 yearly fee)
